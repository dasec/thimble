Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run 'make doxy' which will produce the doxygen documentation of the library
that can be viewed by opening 'doc/html/index.html' in a web-browser. 
Building the documentation requires an installation of 'doxygen' and 
'doxygen-latex'.

The documentation is also available online:

'http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/biometrics/thimble'


Building
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On UNIX run 'make' to build the library 'libthimble.a' and the sample binary
'tarpSample'. To test whether the build was successful run 
'./tarpSample fingerprint.pgm' which should output a directed reference
point estimated from the fingerprint image 'fingerprint.pgm' which should
be contained in THIMBLE's root folder.

For further information see the documentation which also includes a 
description on how to compile THIMBLE and the sample executable for Windows.

tarpSample.cpp   source of a sample program to estimate a fingerprint's
                 directed reference point using the method presented in
                 'B. Tams (2013)' and 
                 'B. Tams, P. Mihailescu, and A. Munk (2015)'

fingerprint.pgm  Example of a fingerprint image from the FVC 2000 DB2-B
                 database scanned at a resolution of 500 dpi as an 
                 input to the sample program 'tarpSample' of which 
                 source code is contained in 'tarpSample.cpp'. The 
                 fingerprint image can be downloaded from 
                 'http://bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2000/download.asp'

doc              contains the doxygen configuration file 'doxy.conf'
                 that is used to build THIMBLE's documentation and the
                 folder  'doc/imgs' in which example images for the 
                 doxygen documentation are stored.
